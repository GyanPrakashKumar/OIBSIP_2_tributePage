                <h2>Personal Life</h2>
                <p>Zuckerberg met his future wife, fellow Harvard student Priscilla Chan, at a frat party during his
                    sophomore year there. They began dating in 2003.In September 2010, Chan, who was by then a medical
                    student at the University of California, San Francisco,moved into Zuckerberg's rented house in Palo
                    Alto, California.On May 19, 2012, they married in the grounds of his mansion in an event that also
                    celebrated her graduation from medical school. On July 31, 2015, Zuckerberg revealed that they were
                    expecting a baby girl and that Chan had previously experienced three miscarriages. Their daughter,
                    Maxima Chan Zuckerberg, was born on December 1, 2015.They announced in a Chinese New Year video that
                    their daughter's Chinese name is Chen Mingyu (Chinese: 陈明宇). Their second daughter, August, was born
                    in
                    August 2017. The couple also have a Puli dog named Beast, who has over two million followers on
                    Facebook. In 2017, Zuckerberg and his wife began a nationwide tour "to visit every state in the
                    union
                    and learn more about a sliver of the nearly two billion people who regularly use the social
                    network". He
                    met with farmers, business owners and even spoke at Mother Emanuel where the 2015 shooting took
                    place.
                </p>
                <p> Raised as a Reform Jew, Zuckerberg later identified as an atheist, but in 2016 said, "I was raised
                    Jewish and then I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is
                    very
                    important."</p>
                <p>
                    In an August 2022 appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Zuckerberg said one of his biggest regrets
                    was
                    competing on the fencing team in high school instead of wrestling. Motherboard implicitly criticized
                    this by comparing it to another potential regret: Facebook's "enabling genocide in Myanmar because
                    it
                    did not bother to hire moderators who speak Burmese", an incident for which Zuckerberg apologized
                    at the time. In the same interview, he also said he regretted that Facebook had throttled posts
                    about the Hunter Biden laptop controversy.</p>
